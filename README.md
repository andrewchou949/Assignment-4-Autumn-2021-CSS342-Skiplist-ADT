#Skiplist
Goals: Working with dynamic arrays, pointers, doubly linked lists

Assignment 4 for CSS342 Autumn 2021 quarter of UWB

This assignment 4 illustrates a skiplist ADT that is capable of finding any element by traversing from one pointer object to another at appropriate level for faster traversing (skiplist structure). This class contains functions to add and remove item to skiplist while still maintaining the structure. On top of that, it has functions to confirm whether any elements is in the skiplist by using contain(), which will quickly compare and traverse the list at appropriate level.
