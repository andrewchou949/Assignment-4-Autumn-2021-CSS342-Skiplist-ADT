Instruction for Skiplist Assignment During Class:

Concept of algorithmic efficiency
Find thing in the skiplist by O(Log2n) not O(n).

Only one level (Skiplist(1))
Level 0: Doubly linked list
Constructor should do what
When creating the node, where should it point to?
Start with doubly linked list and test constructor/destructor (Delete thing -- Running valgrind to see memory leakage)

Try with multi layer skiplist
Can try change the randrange to be 100% to test (Easier)
To simply check if the node points appropriately, add correctly...etc

*Doubly link list: points to previous and after it.
*Regardless of level, each node has 4 points (Up down prev and after).

*Add method, one is add one at a time. : Assume no duplication
*The other add method with vector as param, we can add multiple at the same time. (Can call the previous add method): Assume no duplication

Front guard and Rear guard: Used to test if we reach the start or end side yet (the -INF or +INF). TO prevent going off the range.
Front Guard |L(3)----------| Rear Guard
Front Guard |L(2)----------| Rear Guard
Front Guard |L(1)----------| Rear Guard
Front Guard |L(0)----------| Rear Guard
